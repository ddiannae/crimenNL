* Introduction
In order to relate the urban environment of Monterrey to its crime, we used the data of Open street
map (OSM). The data model of OSM consists of three elements: nodes, ways, and relations; where nodes
are geographical points in the map representing an urban item (e.g. a bench, or a bar), ways are
sets of nodes defining the shape of an item (e.g. a river, or a road), and relations are sets of
ways, nodes and other relations, defining urban compounds like a university campus or a park.

We filtered the database in order to consider only the roads and amenities of the city, that is 
nodes belonging to any kind of rode from highway to walking path, and nodes belonging to
any private or public establishments.
